# Math for the Layman

Math boils down to these sorts of objects, actions, and features:

- objects
  - list (vector)
  - list list (tensor, matrix)
  - unique list (set)
  - space (physical space)
  - point (in space)
    - vertex (point connected by lines)
  - link (edge)
  - relation
  - line
  - path
  - number
  - net
  - map
  - repeat
  - position
  - type
  - loop
    - cycle
  - field
    - curve
    - surface
    - volume
  - symmetry
  - machine (automata)
  - rule (if-then)
  - combinator (group)
    - 1-combinator (group)
    - 2-combinator (ring)
    - 4-combinator (field)
  - sequence
  - series
- actions
  - operations (actions on objects)
  - transformation
    - rotate
    - skew
    - translate
    - scale
    - reflect
  - combination
    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide
- features
  - associative
  - homeomorphic
  - complete
  - isogonal
    - each vertex is equivalent under symmetries of figure

Each of these has dozens or hundreds of sub-types focusing on different aspects of the structure.
